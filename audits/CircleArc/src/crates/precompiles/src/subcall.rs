//! Subcall precompile trait and types.
//!
//! Defines the two-phase execution interface for precompiles that need to spawn
//! child EVM call frames. Implementations live alongside this module (e.g.,
//! [`crate::call_from::CallFromPrecompile`]). The registry and continuation storage
//! that drives the execution loop live in `arc-evm`.

/// Trait for precompiles that spawn child EVM call frames.
///
/// Implementors define a two-phase execution model:
/// - [`init_subcall`](SubcallPrecompile::init_subcall): Decodes the precompile input and returns a
///   child call request plus any continuation state needed for completion.
/// - [`complete_subcall`](SubcallPrecompile::complete_subcall): Receives the child call result and
///   continuation state, producing the final precompile output.
///
/// # Constraint: child target must not be a subcall precompile
///
/// The child frame returned by `init_subcall` is dispatched via revm's standard
/// `init_with_context`, which does **not** consult the subcall registry. If
/// `child_inputs.target_address` is another subcall precompile address, the call will hit the
/// stub bytecode at that genesis address (typically `0x01` / `ADD`) and silently revert, rather
/// than triggering the target's two-phase execution.
///
/// Indirect calls work fine: if the child targets a regular contract that then CALLs a subcall
/// precompile, the CALL opcode triggers a new `frame_init` cycle through `ArcEvm`, which
/// consults the subcall registry as expected.
///
/// # No separate checkpoint around child execution
///
/// The subcall framework does **not** take a separate journal checkpoint around the child
/// execution. The child frame's own checkpoint (managed by revm's `make_call_frame` /
/// `process_next_action`) handles commit/revert based on the child's success or failure.
///
/// If `complete_subcall` returns `success: false` or `Err` when the child succeeded, the
/// child's state changes will **not** be reverted — they are already committed. Implementors
/// should be aware of this when designing their completion logic.
///
/// Returning `success: true` when the child failed is fine (e.g., `CallFromPrecompile`
/// always succeeds and encodes the child's outcome in its output bytes). The child's
/// checkpoint was already reverted, so no state leaks.
